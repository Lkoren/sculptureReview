Docs:

The rc.local file has been modified to run the sculpture server on startup under
user 'Pi', as well as to bring up the ethernet and wifi interfaces. If this needs
to be reproduced add the following lines to /etc/rc.local:

# Bring up the ethernet interface:
# eth0 addition:
sudo ifconfig eth0 ***.**.**.*** netmask 255.255.255.0 up

# start the server under the correct user ID:
sudo -u pi python /home/pi/sculpture/theSculpture.py &

A copy of the raspberry Pi public ssh key *must* be in the sculpture's
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
